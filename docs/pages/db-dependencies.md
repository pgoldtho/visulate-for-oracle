# Analyze database object dependencies

Visulate for Oracle provides a UI and APIs to identify database object dependencies.

Every Oracle database maintains a record of the dependencies between its objects in the SYS schema's DEPENDENCY$ table. It queries this table to identify the status of an object. For example, a stored procedure is marked as invalid if you drop a table that it relies on. Visulate for Oracle provides APIs which read the same table.

## Using the UI

Dependency reports are included at the bottom of each database object report. For example, to view the dependencies for a table use the navigation menu or search box to open its object report.

![Table details](/images/table-details.png){: class="screenshot" tabindex="0" }

Scroll to the bottom of the page to see a list of object (e.g. packages, package bodies and views) that reference the table.

![Dependencies](/images/dependencies.png){: class="screenshot" tabindex="0" }

Clicking on an object name in the dependency list will take you to a report showing its definition. For example, selecting a package body will open a report that shows the source code for the package body and a list of the SQL statement it contains.

## Using the object report API

The database object report that the UI displays can also be accessed via an API call. Call the `/api` endpoint passing the database, schema, object type and object name as path parameters `/api/{database}/{schema}/{object type}/{object name}` Example:

``` shell
curl -X GET "https://my-domain.com/api/my-db/WIKI/PACKAGE/RNT_MENUS_PKG" \
-H  "accept: application/json" | json_pp

## Using the object collection API

The object collection API is used to identify a collection of objects along with the dependent objects that are needed to create them. It is designed to support partial schema migrations where a subset of the objects in a schema are to be migrated to a new database.

The object collection API accepts one or more object patterns as input and returns a collection of matching objects and their "uses" dependencies. An object pattern is an object describing a combination of owner, type, name and status. For example, the following pattern identifies objects in the "APPS" schema with an object name that start with "AP_BANK" of any type and status

```
[
  {
    "owner": "APPS",
    "type": "*",
    "name": "AP_BANK*",
    "status": "*"
  }
]
```

The API converts "*" characters to "%" and assembles a list of matching objects by running the following query

```
select  object_id, object_name, object_type, owner
from dba_objects
where  owner = :owner
and object_type like :object_type
and object_name like :object_name
and status like :status
and rownum < 3000
and object_type not in ('INDEX PARTITION','INDEX SUBPARTITION', 'LOB','LOB PARTITION','TABLE PARTITION','TABLE SUBPARTITION')
order by owner, object_type, object_name
```

For each matching object it queries the SYS.DEPENDENCY$ table to identify its "uses" dependencies. These are objects that need to exist for a valid install of the matched object. For example, the API would return FND_CURRENCIES in the result set for the AP_BANK* pattern if it matched a package body called AP_BANK_CHARGE_PKG which included a SQL statement that selects from FND_CURRENCIES

The object collection API is accessed by calling the `/api/collection/` endpoint passing the database as a path parameter `/api/collection/{database}` and an object pattern in the body of a POST request. Example:

```
curl \
-L 'https://my-domain.com/api/collection/vis115' \
-H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
-o collection_dependencies.json \
-d @- << EOF
[
  {
    "owner": "RNTMGR2",
    "type": "%",
    "name": "PR_RECORDS_PKG",
    "status": "*"
  },
  {
    "owner": "RNTMGR2",
    "type": "%",
    "name": "PR_PUMS_PKG",
    "status": "*"
  }
]
EOF
