# Troubleshooting

## Database registration failure

Database registration failures typically appear while updating the deployment but are usually caused by errors in the database registration file.

### Pod errors: CrashLoopBackOff

Errors appear on the API Server deployment screen after applying an updated manifest. Example:
```
CrashLoopBackOff Container 'message-log' keeps crashing.
CrashLoopBackOff Container 'visulate-api' keeps crashing.
```

#### What does this mean?
This typically indicates an issue with the database registration file. The deployment container logs may provide additional information. These can be accessed from the Deployment details page. For example, API server will throw an error if there are syntax errors in the registration file. Look for an error like this:

```
{
  "textPayload": "SyntaxError: Unexpected token '{'
      at wrapSafe (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1054:16)
      at Module._compile (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1102:27)
      at Object.Module._extensions..js (internal/modules/cjs/loader.js:1158:10)
 ...
}
```
Deployment updates can also fail if the database registration secret was created with the wrong key. If you don't see any syntax errors in the log files it could be an issue with the key. The database registration secret key must be `database.js`. Open the Configuration page in the GKE console for your database registration secret. Examine the key name in the Data section of the page:

![Checking the key](/images/db-secret.png){: class="screenshot" tabindex="0"}

#### How do I fix it?
Follow the [validation instructions](/pages/database-registration.html#validate-the-file-for-javascript-syntax-errors) in the database registration guide to check for errors. Create a new secret with the updated file then update the API Server deployment.


### Pod unschedulable

The rolling update to a new configuration hangs. The old pods are still active and new ones are not created.

![PodUnschedulable](/images/pod-unschedulable.png){: class="screenshot" tabindex="0" }

#### What does this mean?
There are insufficient resources in the cluster. See [GKE troubleshooting](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/troubleshooting#PodUnschedulable) guide.

#### How do I fix it?
Add resources to the cluster or reduce the number of API Server replicas.

### kubectl apply fails with Conflict

kubectl returns an error when attempting to update the database registration file secret. Example:
```
$ kubectl apply -f ../dev-files/deployment.yaml
Error from server (Conflict): error when applying patch:
{ "metadata":{"annotations":{"deployment.kubernetes.io/revision"

 ...

:"Progressing"}],"observedGeneration":1,"replicas":1}}
to:
Resource: "extensions/v1beta1, Resource=deployments",
GroupVersionKind: "extensions/v1beta1, Kind=Deployment"
Name: "visulate-1-visulate-api", Namespace: "default"
for: "../dev-files/deployment.yaml":
Operation cannot be fulfilled on deployments.extensions "visulate-1-visulate-api":
the object has been modified; please apply your changes to the latest version and try again
```
#### What does this mean?
The deployment configuration has changed since the manifest was created.

#### How do I fix it?
Follow the instructions in the [database registration](/pages/database-registration.html#update-the-api-server-deployment)
guide to generate a new one.


## Registered database does not appear in the UI drop down
Follow these steps if the database registration succeeds but some (or all) of your databases are missing.

### Call the /endpoints api
The endpoints api lists valid and invalid database connections. Call the api with no arguments to get a list of valid connections. Pass `status=invalid` as a get parameter to identify invalid ones. Example:

```
curl https://catalog.visulate.net:3000/endpoints?status=invalid
{"ora18xe":{"connectString":"ap884.visulate.net:91521/XEPDB1","error":"Get connection timed out after 5000 ms"}}
```

### Review the API Server deployment log files
The API Server writes logfile entries when the connection fails. These can be accessed from the Deployment details page of the GKE console by selecting the "Container logs" link. They can also be accessed from an api server pod. Use kubectl exec to login to the pod. The logfiles are located in the /visulate-server/logs directory.

```
kubectl exec -it {visulate-api-podname} -- bash

bash-4.2# cd logs

bash-4.2# pwd
/visulate-server/logs

bash-4.2# ls
access.log  combined.log  error.log

head -50 combined.log
```

### Make an API call

The UI calls the /api/ endpoint to get the list of databases to display in the dropdown. Use curl to call it.

```shell
# Find the ingress ip address (substitute your ingress name for "visulate-1-igs")
INGRESS_IP=$(kubectl get ingress visulate-1-igs \
  --namespace default \
  --output jsonpath='{.status.loadBalancer.ingress[0].ip}')

# get the database list and pipe to json_pp for formatting
curl http://${INGRESS_IP}/api/ | json_pp

  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  3903  100  3903    0     0   5481      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  5474
{
   "endpoints" : [
      {
         "connectString" : "db25.visulate.net:401521/XEPDB1",
         "description" : "18c PDB instance running in a docker container",
         "endpoint" : "oracle18E",
         "schemas" : {
            "HR" : [

...
}
```

### Check your browser developer tools for network and console errors
Use the network tab to examine the request to the /api/ endpoint. The response should equal the curl request above. Make sure the Object Filter field in the UI is empty. This is passed as a get parameter to the API. It adds a wildcard filter to the result set which could cause a database to be excluded.

### Check the username, password and connect string

Follow the instructions in the [network configuration guide](/pages/network-configuration.html) to open a bash shell in one of the API server pods. Navigate to the "/visulate-server/config" directory. Use the cat command to view the contents of the "database.js" file.

```
bash-4.2# cd /visulate-server/config
bash-4.2# cat database.js
```

This file holds the credentials that the API server read on startup to establish database connection pools. See the [database registration guide](/pages/database-registration.html) for additional details

### Test your firewall rules

Follow the steps in the [network configuration guide](/pages/network-configuration.html)

### Check the Visulate account permissions

The visulate account must have been granted CREATE SESSION, SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE and SELECT ANY DICTIONARY. It must not have any additional privileges for security reasons. The API server checks the account's privileges on startup. It drops the connection if it finds any more or less that the required set. These appear in the API Server log file:
```
{"level":"info","message":"Creating poolAlias system for db25.visulate.net:401521/XEPDB1",
         "timestamp":"2020-05-11T19:40:57.104Z"}
...
{"level":"error","message":"Closing poolAlias system. Account has invalid privileges.
          Expected: 'CREATE SESSION,SELECT ANY DICTIONARY,SELECT_CATALOG_ROLE'
          Found: 'AQ_ADMINISTRATOR_ROLE,CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW,CREATE TABLE,DBA,DEQUEUE ANY QUEUE,
          ENQUEUE ANY QUEUE,GLOBAL QUERY REWRITE,MANAGE ANY QUEUE,SELECT ANY TABLE,UNLIMITED TABLESPACE'",
         "timestamp":"2020-05-11T19:41:04.414Z"}
```

## Lost database registration file

See [Check the username, password and connect string](#check-the-username-password-and-connect-string) step above.


## Orphaned network resources
Network resources that were created to support the ingress are usually removed automatically when the Visulate application is deleted. There are 2 circumstances where this automatic cleanup can fail:
1. The combined length of the namespace and instance name exceed 32 characters
2. The loadbalancer that supports the ingress was updated manually

### Namespace and instance name exceed 32 characters
This is an issue with Google's ingress implementation see [GCP Marketplace Tools issue 495](https://github.com/GoogleCloudPlatform/marketplace-k8s-app-tools/issues/495).

You need to manually delete the orphaned resources. Open the Load balancing page under Network services to remove backend services, health checks and SSL certs:

![Delete the load balancer](/images/delete-lb.png){: class="screenshot" tabindex="0"}

Then open the External IP addresses under VPC network to release the IP address:

![Delete IP address](/images/delete-ip.png){: class="screenshot" tabindex="0"}

### Manual edits to the load balancer
Orphaned resources can also occur if you made manual edits to the load balancer that was created to support the ingress (e.g. as described in the [upgrade guide](/pages/upgrade-guide.html#add-a-new-ip-address-and-forwarding-rule-to-the-load-balancer)).  Manually delete the load balancer and IP address as described above. You may also need to manually delete the ingress.
