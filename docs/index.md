    <p>Visulate for Oracle is a Cloud-based application to browse and search Oracle databases.
    Users create connections from a central server to each database and then query them
    using REST APIs or a browser.</p>

    <h2>Common use cases</h2>
  </header>
</div>

### On-Premises to Cloud migration
Document and analyze on-premises environments prior to migration. Evaluate proprietary feature usage in each database. Identify "lift and shift" projects and candidates for conversion to microservices or other database engines. Download the DDL for refactoring. Find direct and indirect dependencies for objects in microservice candidates. Generate CSV files to seed the new instance.

### Re-write PL/SQL for the cloud
Examine custom PL/SQL and other database related program logic in stored procedures, packages and triggers. Extract SQL statements and business logic. Rewrite in other languages.

### Decommission zombie database instances
Review the contents of old databases. What are they running? Are they still needed or were they left running because no one turned them off. Identify targets for consolidation or decommissioning.

### Custom development
Document custom code in your Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) application database. Review the schema definitions in your E-Business Suite database. Examine dependencies before a schema change. Download and diff the DDL for objects in development and test environments.

### License management
Catalog all of your company's Oracle database instances in preparation for a compliance audit. Identify Enterprise Edition feature and option usage. Find Enterprise Edition license instances that could be be downgraded to Standard Edition 2. Catalog and analyze Oracle database instances on GCP Bare Metal, Oracle Cloud Platform or other Cloud providers.
