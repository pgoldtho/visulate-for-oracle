      <p>Support for Oracle database migrations to Google Cloud Platform</p>
    </header>
    <p>Visulate for Oracle is a Cloud-based application to catalog and query Oracle databases during
    migration to GCP. Users create connections from a central server to each database and then query
    using REST APIs or a browser.</p>

### On-Premises to GCP Bare Metal

Document and analyze on-premises environments prior to migration. Review system utilization for capacity planning. Evaluate proprietary feature usage in each database. Identify "lift and shift" projects and candidates for conversion to microservices or other database engines.

Document custom code in Commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) application databases. Review the schema definitions in E-Business Suite databases.

Catalog Oracle database instances. Identify Enterprise Edition feature and option usage. Find Enterprise Edition license instances that could be be downgraded to Standard Edition 2. Review the contents of old databases. Identify targets for consolidation or decommissioning.

### Oracle Data Warehouse to Big Query

Analyze star, snowflake and 3NF schemas in the Oracle data warehouse. Execute queries to review data values and prototype denormalized structures. Generate CSV from SQL statements for download as files or streaming to Google Cloud Storage. Generate code stubs from Oracle table and PL/SQL metadata for use in ETL tools. Replicate data from Oracle via REST APIs.

### Oracle OLTP to Cloud SQL for PostgreSQL

Review Oracle schemas to identify Oracle specific data types and indexes. Examine custom PL/SQL and other database related program logic in stored procedures, packages and triggers. Extract SQL statements and business logic. Rewrite in other languages. Download Oracle DDL for manual conversion to PostgreSQL.

Execute Ora2Pg via an easy to use single page web application or REST API.
